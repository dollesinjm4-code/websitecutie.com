      <div class="overlay">This photo captures my deep passion for playing basketball. It was taken during the finals game, a moment filled with intensity, teamwork, and determination. Through this image, you can truly see the unity and strong connection within my team each player contributing their individual ideas, skills, and strategies to achieve a common goal: victory. Beyond just a game, this experience symbolizes how collaboration, trust, and shared effort can lead to success. This photo not only reminds me of that triumph but also represents the deep bond we built both on and off the court. </div>

      <div class="overlay">This drawing reflects my inner ability and passion for art. Using Adam as my reference, I poured my creativity and dedication into every detail, allowing my deep love for the arts to guide me throughout the process. It took me three days to complete this piece, and during that time, I discovered not only my patience and focus but also how art allows me to express myself in meaningful and inspiring ways.</div>

      <div class="overlay">This photo was taken in General Santos City at the beautiful Isla Jardin resort. I captured this moment because I felt a deep sense of peace and was inspired by my love for photography. The image represents more than just a scenic view it symbolizes how I see myself in the waves of life. Just like the ocean, life has its calm and its storms, but I believe that through peace, understanding, and faith in God’s creations, every challenge can be resolved. This photo reminds me to stay grounded and to always find beauty and serenity even in life’s constant motion.</div>

      <div class="overlay">This photo truly gives me a sense of relief and brings back wonderful memories of the activities we shared during that time. It captures not only my love for nature but also my deep appreciation for how amazing God is in creating such beautiful things around us. During this adventure, I experienced moments of realization and reflection that opened my heart and mind, helping me understand life more clearly. It was through this journey and with the company and support of these wonderful people that I felt closer to God and more connected to the beauty of His creations.</div>
